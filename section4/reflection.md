## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
- I'll be honest, I didn't really have the luxury of huge blocks of time to commit to class this week (my wedding is this weekend). Most of my breaks were due to my schedule forcing me to stop. But, I'm finding pomodoro breaks in Mod0 classes to be pretty helpful.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
- Again, I think this week is an awful representation about what my time during Mod1 - 4 will really look like. I've been balancing quitting my job and planning a wedding, so I've committed time to the class when I've had it, but it's not been very consistent. However, when I came back to my work, I found I was able to focus better on the task at hand. Even if my breaks were longer than 5 minutes!

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
- While both of these function somewhat similarly in the sense that they handle a collection of data, Arrays hold an ordered list of data that are accessed by indexes. Objects can be pulled using strings, as well as indexes. Objects can also be built out to hold a lot more specific data to each item in it.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  - Array, if we're just listing names. We don't need all the bells and whistles of an Object.
  * List of states and their capitals
  - Object. We can line up the states with their capitals as key-value pairs.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  - Array. Again, this is a pretty straightforward list and doesn't need too much details.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  - Array. If all you need is a list of names, an Object would be overkill.
  * List of student names and their cohort
  - Object. Key-Value pairs of students:cohorts could be helpful for pulling data in the future.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  - Object! While it first seems like an Array would be helpful, pairing up the ingredients with their measurements works better in an Object.
  * All my favorite restaurants
  - Just the names? Array. Name, type of food, price point, and address? Use an Object!

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
- Any type of online shopping likely heavily utilizes Objects with key-value pairs.
  - Some example keys could be: __type of clothing__, __color__, __price__, __is it on sale__ (bool)
  - Associate values could be: "Dresses", "Red", 55, true
- Ebay especially comes to mind when thinking about this. They require all sellers to fill out certain attributes of each sellable object (size, type, features, exp. date, etc). If you don't fill it out, you can't submit the product to be sold. So, these categories both help the user narrow down their search on the front end, but it helps ebay organize/manipulate data on the back end as needed, as well.  

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
- No questions! I love how powerful and flexible these are and they are fun to work with. Just need to continue working with them!
