## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
- After reading this article, it actually made me a bit sad. I used to be an avid reader and I lost
that passion for reading when my career started taking most of my free time. I'm definitely rusty
now in alot of these super learner traits, but I definitely think the growth mindset is still
alive and well with me, coming from a musician background. The thing I need to work hardest on
is taking efficient breaks. I think this list is pretty comprehensive and I can't think of anything
I would add.  

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
- We learned about **String**, **Number** and **Boolean** datatypes.
  - String: This datatype consists of letters or other chars, wrapped in single or double quotes
  - Number: This datatype handles all types of numbers. Negatives, decimals, whole numbers, and more.
  - Boolean: This datatype only evaluates to one of two options, __true__ or __false__.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
`console.log("Hello World!")`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
- We have two options for comments. An inline comment uses two slashes (//) or a block comment which
consists of asterisk and slash (/* */). Comments are extremely helpful in providing context throughout
your code, especially when working with others. They can also help visually by breaking up long blocks
of code.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
- A variable is probably the most important building block we have towards making programs. It stores
bits of data for us that we can then use and manipulate throughout a program.
- If I were to explain this to a five year old, I would say a variable is like an empty jar. when
we place a cookie in it, it now holds one cookie (our variable value). We can keep that cookie in there or we can remove the cookie, and replace it with something else.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
- I like checking the weather on a daily basis. I would imagine most weather apps and sites use variables like **todaysForecast**, **temperature** and **currentWeather**.
  - todaysForecast: Likely would hold a string describing today's predicted weather
  - temperature: Definitely a number
  - currentWeather: Could go either the string route, or the boolean route (aka is it currently raining? it either is or it isnt).

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
- Concatenation allows us to pull together different data types into one string. We must use the + operator in order to do so.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
- For me, its hard to think of a site or app that wouldn't use concatenation. Clear and concise code is very important for so many reasons, and concatenation is a tool that not only helps to pull together different data types into one output, but it significantly cuts back on redundant coding.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
- No questions! Just enjoying the process.
