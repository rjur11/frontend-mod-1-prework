## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
- I definitely lean more towards in between or waiting too long to ask questions. I have found that I let myself get to "smashing head against wall" territory way too often and while I'm not shy to ask questions in the moment, its usually been more of a "I don't want to bother someone with my question" problem.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
- Everything felt pretty good. I definitely had to look back just once with the node command to remember the syntax for it, but for me, doing things over and over again really helps me to learn. So I appreciate this approach!

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
- A conditional statement is one that handles a necessary decision. Based off of the input, it will follow a certain
path through the program. A daily life conditional could be choosing to sleep in or to get out of bed and work out in the morning. If you sleep in, you're more rested, but if you work out, you're getting fit and starting your day off early. Any type of form in a web application is likely a conditional. Especially if it has hidden portions that pop up if you answer a question with a specific answer.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
- You can chain together multiple conditions to an `if statement` with the use of `else if` statements following your first condition. You will end the final condition using `else`. The program reads from top to bottom. Is the first condition met by the input? If yes, continue past the conditions and output what is needed or continue on in the program. If no, go down one level and check again. Is this condition met? And so on and so forth until you reach the last conditional. At that point the program will take the `else` and move on.  

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
- You could use logical operators to check if two (or more) conditions are being met. Comparison operators might help in the case of checking if only 1 of 2 conditions are met.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
- None!
