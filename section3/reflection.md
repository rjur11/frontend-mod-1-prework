## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- I appreciated in the video that Carmen felt something "off" about her trajectory in her industry, but many
around her suggested it was imposter syndrome. She was able to understand that it wasn't quite that, and she
had enough confidence in her abilities to recognize that she just needed a shift in her thinking. And that shift to
a more growth based mindset helped her so much more than thinking imposter syndrome was setting in
- The article mentioned using SMART goals as a technique that can help with more focused, effective work. I've
heard of them and somewhat used them in the past, but never really had big enough projects to really use them with.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
- Over the last year and a half I have told myself that I do have the capability to learn a new skill (coding) even
though it doesn't come easy to me. I've continued to push myself to learn as much as I can, and keep an open mind
along the way.
- I know I'm not an avid, or even good reader. This is something that I've had to constantly work on in my life.
- My ability to handle mistakes is not great. I often beat myself up more than I should instead of using them as
learning opportunities.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
- I think any weather site or app uses tons of arrays. Storing weekly forecasts, hourly reports, daily weather from
across the states, they're likely all held in arrays. This might be a stretch but radar imaging could be held in
an array full of image clips taken one second apart and spliced together.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
- An array method is a tool (an extension?) that can be used alongside an array to manipulate the data within it.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
- A loop allows us to perform a common operation multiple times. A loop is great for outputting info about
elements in an array, but we can also use it for more generic tasks like outputting a list of numbers.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
- A loop is helpful to us when we want to work through a list of things. For instance, you and your mother
are going to the super market to shop for dinner tonight. She hands you a list and asks you to repeat all the
ingredients she needs to buy. You start at the top of the list and say "We need 2 apples". Once the apples are in the cart, you check off the first bullet point and move to the next, and repeat this process until you've gone through the entire list and your cart is full. The way you worked through the list is the exact way a loop helps us in programming.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
- None right now!
