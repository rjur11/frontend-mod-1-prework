# Array Methods
# What do they do?

1. `Pop`
  - The `pop` method removes the final element in an array.
1. `Push`
  - The `push` method adds an element to the end of an array.
1. `Shift`
  - The `shift` method is the opposite of pop. It removes the first element in the array.
1. `Unshift`
  - The `unshift` method allows us to add an element to the front of an array.
